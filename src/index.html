  <h3>Takeaways</h3>

  <p>
    Predicting categories for input data is called a classification task.

    Classification tasks require an appropriate data representation for the labels
    <ul>
      <li>Common representations of labels include one-hot encoding of categories</li>
    </ul>

    Prepare your data:
    <ul>
      <li>
        It is useful to keep some data aside that the model never sees during training that you can use to evaluate the model. This is called the validation set.
      </li>
    </ul>

    Build and run your model:
    <ul>
      <li>Convolutional models have been shown to perform well on image tasks.</li>
      <li>Classification problems usually use categorical cross entropy for their loss functions.</li>
      <li>Monitor training to see whether the loss is going down and accuracy is going up.</li>
    </ul>

    Evaluate your model:

    <ul>
      <li>Decide on some way to evaluate your model once it's trained to see how well it is doing on the initial problem you wanted to solve.</li>
      <li>Per class accuracy and confusion matrices can give you a finer breakdown of model performance than just overall accuracy.</li>
    </ul>
